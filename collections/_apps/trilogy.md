<p>
	My name is Alex Trautman, and I would make an excellent remote tutor for your web development and data visualization course.
</p>
<h3 class="font-marker">I have the teaching experience:</h3>
<p>
	I have taught high school pre-calc and most recently a backend coding bootcamp focused on <strong>JavaScript</strong> at <a href="" target="_blank">The New School</a> of Atlanta.
</p>
<h3 class="font-marker">I know the technology:</h3>
<p>
	My liberal arts degree in Computer Science gave me the opportunity to learn fundamentals: from linked lists to Github version control.
</p>
<p>
	Since then I have filled in the practical gaps in my knowledge. I am confident working the stack everywhere from <strong>MySQL</strong> to <strong>D3.js</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>.
</p>
<h3 class="font-marker">I have a tutor's mentality:</h3>
<p>
	I am patient by nature, and I have honed that patience in my work experiences with teenagers (ask me about those!).
</p>
<p>
	I come through for <strong>people</strong>. My friends look to me as dependable and loyal, and I strive to be available for my students.
</p>
<h3 class="font-marker">I am self motivated:</h3>
<p>
	Ask me about how I made this page, and check out the rest of my website to see what else I have been working on. 
</p>
<h3 class="font-marker">Need a recommendation?</h3>
<p>
	I would be happy to put you in touch with one of the many educators I have worked with.
</p>
<p>
	Sincerely,
</p>
