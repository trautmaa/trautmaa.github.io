    This position speaks directly to my interests. I love variety, and it looks like Applied Imagination works on many different projects. 
</p>
<p>
    My skillset makes me well suited for this role: I am design-minded with plenty of experience doing mockups in <b>Sketch</b> and the <b>Adobe Suite</b>.
</p>
<p>
    I have strong communication skills honed through many hours of hard work as a math teacher and wilderness therapy guide.
</p>
<p>
    As you can see from my website I am very comfortable working with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
</p>
<p>
    I love learning new technologies. In the past few months I have done <a href="/blog">projects</a> in D3.js and ReGL.
</p>
<p>
    My mix of technical and interpersonal skills make me think I could quickly become an asset to your team. I am also a generally easygoing person who is easy to be around.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. Very sincerely,
</p>
