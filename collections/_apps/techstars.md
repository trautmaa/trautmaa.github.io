<p>
	My name is Alex Trautman, and I am ready to be a Design Associate at Techstars.
</p>
<h3 class="font-patrick">I know the hustle:</h3>
<p>
	After reading Jay Kapoor's 
		<a href="https://jaykapoor.com/my-summer-as-a-techstars-nyc-associate-e4ba258339c4" target="_blank">
			Associate testimonial
		</a>
	, I was fondly reminded of my time as a Founder with <a href="https://goodienation.org/" target="_blank">Goodie Nation</a>'s Hack the Violence program. I would love to help accelerate and nurture tomorrow's tech stars.
</p>
<h3 class="font-patrick">I know the technology:</h3>
<p>
	My <a href="/skills" target="_blank">hard skills</a> will be a boon to our founders. We will use Photoshop and Illustrator, Invision and Sketch to make our products pop.
</p>
<h3 class="font-patrick">I have the soft skills:</h3>
<p>
	Last year I taught math, guided teenagers on wilderness trips, and supported teenagers in therapy. I have the patience and empathy to nurture the most manic founders.
</p>
<h3 class="font-patrick">What does my work look like?</h3>
