    I am writing because I am interested in the role you posted on Hypepotamus.
</p>
<p>
    I am drawn to Deepr I am excited about the way you all are reconsidering music discovery. I am really curious what I would find by looking at who creates the music I love. My speakers alternate <b>Kendrick</b> with <b>Chopin</b>, and <b>I am with you</b> in thinking Spotify could use a better algorithm.
</p>
<p>
    I will fit well into the role you have defined because I have a wide range of experience. I have the front end skills you want, and the <b>Photoshop</b> and <b>Sketch</b> speed you need.
</p>
<p>
    I am <b>independent</b>, <b>organized</b>, and <b>thoughtful</b>. I can and I will be excited to help you in the next stage of launching your product.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon. Very sincerely,
</p>
