    I am really excited about Cardlytics! I want to learn more about working with big data: specifically, helping people better understand it through visualizations. I am just starting to explore libraries like D3.js and REGL that are poised to bridge gaps in understanding Cardlytics' vast stores of data.

    My goal is to <strong>learn</strong>! My proficiency in the Adobe Suite, comfort with interactive and responsive design, and technical proficiency make me believe I could make contributions to Cardlytics immediately, while also meeting my personal goals of expanding my skillset.

    As you might glean from my diverse work history, I love being challenged. Pivoting from Front-End development towards UI / UX Design will bring me that challenge, and I look forward to it.
