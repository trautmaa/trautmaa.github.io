    I am really excited to learn more about Springbot! I want to put my experience building interactive websites to work.

    My expertise with the <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>, <strong>jQuery / HTML / CSS</strong>, and <strong>user-centered design</strong> makes me believe I could hit begin contributing quickly at Springbot.

    Briefly, <strong>I believe small and medium sized businesses</strong> are the backbone of communities. I am a resident of Candler Park, and I love my local Flying Biscuit, Candler Park Market, and Victory. Cities without small businesses quickly become bland; Atlanta's small businesses are what make it so unique!

    <strong>For fun</strong> I love bicycling, ultimate frisbee, and running. I love making at Decatur Makers. I also love cooking with my partner and raising tomatoes at home.
