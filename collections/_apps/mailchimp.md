    I love building things on the web and designing <b>creative user experiences</b>!
</p>
<p>
    My comfort with <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>InVision</b>, <b>Sketch</b>, and the <b>Adobe Suite</b> will make me an immediate contributor to your team.
</p>
<p>
    I am <b>easygoing</b> and an <b>excellent communicator</b>.
</p>

    Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon. Very sincerely,
</p>
