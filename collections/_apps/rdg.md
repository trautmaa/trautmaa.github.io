    I am writing because I am interested in the Front-End Developer position you posted on Hypepotamus.
</p>
<p>
    I am drawn to this role because of the work on your website. I really enjoy the FEMA ads and the Minute Maid campaign.
</p>
<p>
    I will fit well into the role you have defined because of my technical skills. I have expertise in <b>HTML5</b>, Canvas and SVG, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>CSS</b>. I love stepping outside conventional boundaries and discovering new ways to create <b>engaging content</b>.
</p>
<p>
    My long experience playing team sports has built in me a <b>sense of urgency</b>. I can think well beyond code and will be a boon to your team.
</p>
<p>
    I can communicate well and am strongly empathetic. Friends tell me I have a calming presence, and I am an emotionally stabilizing force on teams I join.
</p>
<p>
    For these reasons, technical and interpersonal, I would make a great addition to your team. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to hear from you soon. Very sincerely,
</p>
