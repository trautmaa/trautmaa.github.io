    I love that the Azul Arc website lauds its employees as good people; positive company culture is important to me. I also love to cook, so I think we might find some common ground regarding a love for good food.
</p>
<p>
    My skillset makes me well suited for this role: I am design-minded with plenty of experience doing mockups in Sketch and Illustrator. I also have the ability to bring designs to life, as I work in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with practice in Wordpress.
</p>
<p>
    As this is also a product manager role I would like to speak to my leadership abilities. I am a natural listener and peacekeeper, and these predispositions have helped me as I have worked as a teacher, wilderness guide, and team captain.
</p>
<p>
    My mix of technical and interpersonal skills make me think I would be a great fit for this position. Even better, my positive attitude and love of food make me think I could be a great fit for Azul Arc's culture.
</p>

    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you. Very sincerely,
</p>
