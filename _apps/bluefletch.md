    I am really excited to learn more about BlueFletch! I want to hone my skills building websites and stay on the cutting edge of design trends.

<p>
    My goal is to keep learning! My expertise in the <strong>Adobe Suite</strong>, understanding of <strong>best UX practices</strong>, and practice with <strong>dynamic</strong> sites make me believe I could make contributions to BlueFletch immediately.

    As you might glean from my diverse work history, I love the outdoors, and I am optimistic that I would fit into the existing work culture at BlueFletch easily (I spy bicycles in the lobby and Shooting the Hooch as a work activity).
