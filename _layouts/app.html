                    My name is Alex Trautman. I grew up outside of Boston, Massachusetts loving sports 
                    and the outdoors. I am a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong>, a teacher of Math and Computer Science,
                     and a Wilderness Therapy Guide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2015 I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <strong>Carleton College</strong> 
                    in Northfield, MN. In college I also took many art courses and worked for 
                    the Art and Computer Science departments. I played Division 1 Ultimate Frisbee,
                    captained the my Senior year, and lived on campus in a food and community oriented interest house.

                    I am looking for a position as a {{ page.position }}. I am really excited to 
                    expand my knowledge of web technologies to include data visualization tools 
                    and techniques.

                <p>
                    After graduating from school I found a position as a <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> at a small
                     tech company in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The company is called FourCubed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At FourCubed I had the opportunity to learn an immense amount from a superb 
                    supervisor and work with an excellent team.
                     Over the course of the year I worked with and learned about...
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MySQL</li>
                    <li>Scripting large, weekly database backups to Amazon Web Services with Bash</li>
                    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                    <li>NodeJS</li>
                    <li>Github and Version Control</li>
                    <li>JavaScript / jQuery</li>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS / Sass / Bootstrap</li>
                    <li>Static Site Templating</li>

                <p>
                    The independence and responsibilities of this year helped me grow immeasurably.
                     I am confident in my ability to accept the limits of my knowledge, and this 
                     helps me to rapidly learn new technologies.

                <h3>2016 - 2017</h3>
                <h4>Education, Wilderness and Therapy</h4>
                <p>
                    From September 2016 - September 2017 I spent around 120 days sleeping outside.
                    I had the opportunity to work with teenagers at the highest and lowest points 
                    of their lives, leading them over glorious Rocky Mountain passes and comforting them as
                    they dealt with dehabilitating depression and past trauma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I spent the Fall semester learning the art of <strong>teaching math</strong> through a professional
                    residency at the High Mountain Institute in Leadville, CO. I 
                    planned trigonometry units and taught advanced algebra. I co-led backcountry trips
                    and taught leadership skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Spring I worked as a <strong>Wilderness Therapy Guide</strong> in Waitsfield, Vermont. 
                    My co-leader and I aided students with mental illness and troubled pasts as 
                    they worked through a challenging curriculum designed to help them overcome 
                    their circumstances. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These experiences directed my growth as an educator and wilderness guide. More
                    than anything they honed my patience and ability to empathize.

                <p>
                    In July I moved to Atlanta with my partner, who is a first year medical student 
                    at Emory University. In the Fall I worked developing a startup concept as a <strong>Founder</strong>
                    in Goodie Nation's Hack the Violence program. My concept won the accolade of "Most
                    Innovative Chat Bot" at one of the program's hackathons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This past winter I taught a sophomore <strong>Backend Bootcamp</strong> course at The New School 
                    of Atlanta. My students built personal websites and learned about the web and the
                    basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

                <p>
                    I have worked consistently this whole period as a barista at San Francisco
