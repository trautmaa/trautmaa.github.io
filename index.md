I am a front-end developer excited about data visualization looking to use existing technologies to improve lives.

Most recently I have been building a website for actor [Adam Shaukat](https://trautmaa.github.io/shaukat/) and exploring animation with [regl](http://regl.party/). You can see more coding projects on my [Github](https://github.com/trautmaa).

In Winter of 2018 I taught the Backend Programming Bootcamp at [The New School of Atlanta](https://tnsatlanta.org/). You can see the sites students made here (link coming soon).

Thank you to [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) for her excellent blog. Thanks also to [Joseph R. Tomelleri](http://www.americanfishes.com/), whose drawings I referenced in creating the trout logo.
