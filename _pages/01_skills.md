I love learning new technologies. I am **currently excited to work with:** D3.js, Three.js, regl, Deck.gl.

Here is an ongoing, chronological list of languages, softwares and libraries I have worked with:

<h3>Carleton College</h3>
<h4>2011 - 2015</h4>
I majored in Computer Science at Carleton College. I loved the major for all the problem-solving we got to do. I also really enjoyed the mathier aspects of the major - shoutout to my all-time favorite textbook: [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X) 
* **Python**: majority of coursework. First-ever coding project was my [Connect 4](https://github.com/trautmaa/Connect4) game.
* Java: course on software design, learning about MVC patterns. Final project was a collection of [music-themed games with a GUI](https://github.com/trautmaa/MusicalMadness)
* **C**: We built an interpreter. This was a great way to learn about memory management (malloc, talloc, leaks). Lots of tests. Unfortunately, the repository is private (wouldn't want to give away our answers)
* **Photoshop** and **Illustrator**: Really dove in to some Lynda tutorials and learned how to get Photoshop to do what I wanted. You can see some of my photography on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/)
* **Bash / UNIX**: I worked as assistant systems administrator for the Computer Science department. I spent a summer writing scripts to install Mac OS with our settings on the department's lab computers. Also installing and updating whichever software professors needed for the upcoming year's courses. Learned how to minimize human time needed for installations (we were working on like 60 computers).
* **Graphic Design**: I designed [posters](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/albums/72157656970791344) promoting department events (talks, tea time, etc). I did all these using Gimp (yikes) because we didn't want to buy an Adobe license. Pretty proud of what I was able to do - also see the [GUI](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/21656086360/in/album-72157656970791344/) I made for my group's senior capstone [Task Manager](https://github.com/trautmaa/Task-Manager-Comps-2014-2015) project

<h3>FourCubed</h3>
<h4>Summer 2015 - Summer 2016</h4>
After graduating I wanted to put my interest in graphics and coding to use. I worked for a small company called [FourCubed](http://multisite.preview.fourcubed.com/dev-fourcubed) in Minneapolis, MN. I had the privilege to work directly under an amazing mentor who always encouraged me to spend time learning how things worked.
* **JavaScript**: Amazingly, in my liberal arts CS program I did not get exposed to JS. I could though tell you all about stacks, [merge sort](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) and [Turing Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). I spent many hours learning jQuery and Bootstrap. I also got to design and build the front end for a new web-application from the ground up. This involved [Roots](http://roots.netlify.com/), a static site generator (don't you love that website?), API calls, and learning about templating languages (we used [Jade AKA Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html))
* **Photoshop**: I made a lot of buttons and ads enticing users to try their luck at online gambling.
* **Ruby on Rails** I intermittently debugged our giant Rails application. I am not big on backend development.
* **MySQL** The Ruby on Rails application managed and displayed somewhere around 100gb of data. I often accessed and managed it directly with MySQL. I actually really enjoy creating queries - something about the logic and strategy involved in getting exactly what you want.
* **Bash** We had no backups of the database when I started! I wrote scripts to automatically *dump*, *compress*, and *upload* our database to **Amazon AWS** weekly. This worked like a charm; I'm really proud of figuring that one out.
* **HTML / CSS** of course. Lots of practice creating pages from scratch, hacking apart Wordpress to do what I wanted, and crashing around within someone else's HTML and CSS.
* **Bootstrap*

<h3>Outdoor Education</h3>
<h4>Summer 2016 - Summer 2017</h4>
I spent this fall in a [professional residency program](http://www.hminet.org) for traditional and outdoor education in Leadville, CO. The spring I summer I worked as a [wilderness therapy guide](http://truenorthwilderness.com/) in northern Vermont.
* **Wilderness First Responder** / **CPR** / **AED**
* Trained in **Nonviolent Crisis Intervention** through [CPI](https://www.crisisprevention.com/Specialties/Nonviolent-Crisis-Intervention)

<h3>Atlanta</h3>
<h4>Summer 2017 - Present</h4>
* **Product Development** I worked with the Goodie Nation team to go from moonshot to reality. I am particularly proud of the [user interface I created for Village](https://invis.io/CBEIANM3D) using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [inVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). At the Goodie Nation Social Impact Hackathon my design and app won the shout-out for "Most Innovative Chatbot Design."
* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** I taught a Backend Programming Bootcamp at The New School of Atlanta. This was a 6-week course, and we went from very little experience to creating webpages for local businesses from nothing! Link to their portfolios coming soon.
* **Jekyll** I made a [website](trautmaa.github.io/shaukat) for my friend who is an actor. It was a great excuse to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and how to setup Github Pages. Also all about **Mapbox**.
* **ReGL** Check out a short ReGL example on my site [here](/data).

<h3>Future</h3>
I want to work more with data visualization tools like **Three.js**, **ReGL**, [D3](https://d3js.org/) and Uber's [Deck.gl](https://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/). I'm really excited by [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce)'s work in The New York Times. Data Visualization is the future! This is what I'm working on in my free time.
