I love learning new technologies. I am **currently excited to work with:** D3.js, Three.js, regl, Deck.gl.

Here is an ongoing, chronological list of languages, softwares and libraries I have worked with:

<h3>Carleton College</h3>
<h4>2011 - 2015</h4>
I majored in Computer Science at Carleton College. I loved the major for all the problem-solving we got to do. I also really enjoyed the mathier aspects of the major - shoutout to my all-time favorite textbook: [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X) 
* **Python**: majority of coursework. First-ever coding project was my [Connect 4](https://github.com/trautmaa/Connect4) game.
* Java: course on software design, learning about MVC patterns. Final project was a collection of [music-themed games with a GUI](https://github.com/trautmaa/MusicalMadness)
* **C**: We built an interpreter. This was a great way to learn about memory management (malloc, talloc, leaks). Lots of tests. Unfortunately, the repository is private (wouldn't want to give away our answers)
* **Photoshop** and **Illustrator**: Really dove in to some Lynda tutorials and learned how to get Photoshop to do what I wanted. You can see some of my photography on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/)
* **Bash / UNIX**: I worked as assistant systems administrator for the Computer Science department. I spent a summer writing scripts to install Mac OS with our settings on the department's lab computers. Also installing and updating whichever software professors needed for the upcoming year's courses. Learned how to minimize human time needed for installations (we were working on like 60 computers).
* **Graphic Design**: I designed [posters](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/albums/72157656970791344) promoting department events (talks, tea time, etc). I did all these using Gimp (yikes) because we didn't want to buy an Adobe license. Pretty proud of what I was able to do - also see the [GUI](https://www.flickr.com/photos/alextrautman/21656086360/in/album-72157656970791344/) I made for my group's senior capstone [Task Manager](https://github.com/trautmaa/Task-Manager-Comps-2014-2015) project

<h3>FourCubed</h3>
<h4>Summer 2015 - Summer 2016</h4>
After graduating I wanted to put my interest in graphics and coding to use. I worked for a small company called [FourCubed](http://multisite.preview.fourcubed.com/dev-fourcubed) in Minneapolis, MN. I had the privilege to work directly under an amazing mentor who always encouraged me to spend time learning how things worked.
* **JavaScript** I worked with jQuery to make dynamic pages. I also worked to design and build a frontend for a new product. We used [Roots](http://roots.netlify.com/), and I setup API calls. I also learned about templating languages (we used [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html))
* **Photoshop** I created call-to-action buttons, ads
* **Ruby on Rails** I helped to debug our large-scale Rails application
* **MySQL** I gathered data for business reports
* **Bash** I wrote scripts to automatically *dump*, *compress*, and *upload* our database to **Amazon AWS** weekly. This worked like a charm; I'm really proud of figuring that one out.
* **HTML / CSS** Grid, Sass, following best practices.
* **Wordpress** I wrote JavaScript and PHP to make our Wordpress site more flexible.
* **Bootstrap**
* **Google Analytics** I worked with our marketing team to track user flow and conversion.

<h3>Outdoor Education</h3>
<h4>Summer 2016 - Summer 2017</h4>
I spent this fall in a [professional residency program](http://www.hminet.org) for traditional and outdoor education in Leadville, CO. The spring I summer I worked as a [wilderness therapy guide](http://truenorthwilderness.com/) in northern Vermont.
* **Wilderness First Responder** / **CPR** / **AED**
* Trained in **Nonviolent Crisis Intervention** through [CPI](https://www.crisisprevention.com/Specialties/Nonviolent-Crisis-Intervention)

<h3>Atlanta</h3>
<h4>Summer 2017 - Present</h4>
* **Product Development** I worked with the Goodie Nation team to go from moonshot to reality. I am particularly proud of the [user interface I created for Village](https://invis.io/CBEIANM3D) using [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [inVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). At the Goodie Nation Social Impact Hackathon my design and app won the shout-out for "Most Innovative Chatbot Design."
* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** I taught a Backend Programming Bootcamp at The New School of Atlanta. This was a 6-week course, and we went from very little experience to creating webpages for local businesses from nothing! Link to their portfolios coming soon.
* **Jekyll** I made a [website](trautmaa.github.io/shaukat) for my friend who is an actor. It was a great excuse to learn [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and how to setup Github Pages. Also all about **Mapbox**.
* **ReGL** Check out a short ReGL example on my site [here](/data).

<h3>Future</h3>
I want to work more with data visualization tools like **Three.js**, **ReGL**, [D3](https://d3js.org/) and Uber's [Deck.gl](https://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/). I'm really excited by [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce)'s work in The New York Times. Data Visualization is the future! This is what I'm working on in my free time.
